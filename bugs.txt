Presentation
	Server-side tech: mongodb, sockets, invite system, custom authorization and conneciton keys
		->demo: show concurrency and overlap
	
	Client-side tech: custom canvas tools from scratch, pan, overlap (made sure that
		the paint app behaved as the user expected is very important in this app), custom
		pages plugin to "redirect", 
	
	interesting/challenging element: 
		1. sync and overlap the same across sessions and users
		2. serverside: multiple saves and db accesses
